# React State Example - Todo List

This is the single monolithic todo list app reworked into components using props to pass the state around. This also has Prop Validation added as an example, the library is included as a dependency already so there is no need to run `npm install prop-types --save` to make it work.

## Getting it to run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install everything.
3. Run `npm run dev` as normal to make it work.
